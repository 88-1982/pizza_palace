## Description
  Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.

Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.
Keep it simple to start! You do not need to have a complex formula for determining cost (although you can if you like). The most important part of this code review is using and demonstrating your understanding of constructors and prototypes.




## Specifications
Describe: forLoop(number)

Test 1: "It will create a pizza object with topping and size properties."
code: pizza1.size; "medium"
Expect: pizza1 = new pizza ([pepperoni,green onion],medium).toEqual(pizza1 {toppings: ["pepperoni","green onion"], size: "medium"});
